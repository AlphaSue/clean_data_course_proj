My Course Project
======================

This is my course project for Coursera course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) taught by [Professor Jeffrey Leek](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/research.html).

This repository includes three items:
----------------------

* An well-commented R script called run_analysis.R that does the analysis and creates the tidy data set by doing the following:

>1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
>2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
>3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
>4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
>5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


* CodeBook.md 

>A markdown file that a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data.

* README.md

>This file. It explains how the scripts work, contents of the repository, and how the contents are connected.

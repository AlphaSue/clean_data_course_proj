My Course Project
======================

This is my course project for Coursera course "[Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata)" taught by Jeffrey Leek.

This repo includes three items:
----------------------

* An R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


* CodeBook.md  - a markdown file that a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data.


Additional information

The data used in the project represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
